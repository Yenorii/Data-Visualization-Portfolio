## Yenori Alvarez's Data Visualization Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Visualization Portfolio! Here, you will find a collection of projects I have worked on using various tools and technologies in data science and analysis. Each project is unique, uncovering different insights across various sectors and telling stories mainly through visual representations.
